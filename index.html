        <h2>Key Features of Our Maze Generator</h2>
        <h3>Access Without Sign-In or Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          One great feature of our Maze Generator tool is that you can create
          mazes without having to sign in or create an account.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is beneficial because it saves you time; there's no need to go
          through the sign-in process to use our site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike many similar tools that require signing in, which can pose
          risks as your credentials and data are stored on their servers, our
          tool operates without this requirement.
        </p>
        <h3>Personalize Maze Settings</h3>
        <p>
          Not satisfied with the default maze appearance? No problem! Our tool
          offers an option to customize the maze according to your preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can adjust various elements such as size, complexity, wall color,
          background color, solved color, and more to suit your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can utilize this feature to customize the appearance of the maze
          according to your preferences for social media posts, websites, books,
          or wherever you intend to use it.
        </p>
        <h3>Customize Maze Color</h3>
        <p>
          Customizing the maze color is beneficial because, as mentioned
          earlier, it allows you to align the maze with the theme of your social
          media, website, or book.
        </p>
        <p>
          By default, we've included a collection of popular and well-balanced
          colors for your convenience. Simply click on the color you prefer to
          apply to the maze.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if you wish to use your own custom color, you can enter the
          color hex code into the input field to change the color accordingly.
        </p>
        <h3>Retrieve Maze Solution</h3>
        <p>
          If you also need the solution for the maze you just generated, you're
          in luck! Now, with just one click, you can access the solution for the
          current maze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the solution is revealed, you can save it as a PNG image on your
          device. This feature is particularly helpful if you encounter a
          challenging maze quiz that you're unable to solve on your own.
        </p>
        <h3>Save the Maze</h3>
        <p>
          The last and most important feature is being able to save the maze as
          a PNG image directly to your device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you're happy with the maze you made, just click on "Download
          Image" to get it on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't need to pay for a premium monthly subscription or a paid
          plan to download the maze. It's totally free to save it on your
          device.
        </p>
